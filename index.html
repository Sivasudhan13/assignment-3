              What Does C plus plus Programming Language Mean? C++ (said C plus
              plus) is an object-oriented computer language created by notable
              computer scientist Bjorne Stroustrop as part of the evolution of
              the C family of languages.

            <dt><h4>What is different between C and C++?</h4></dt>
            <dd>
              C is a structural or procedural programming language that was used
              for system applications and low-level programming applications.
              Whereas C++ is an object-oriented programming language having some
              additional features like Encapsulation, Data Hiding, Data
              Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism, etc.

            <dd>
              Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model
              that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather
              than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field
              that has unique attributes and behavior.
